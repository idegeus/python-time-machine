# python-time-machine
Simple python application to change the local computer time using a tkinter GUI. If you're just here for the application,download the most recent [release](https://github.com/ivotje50/python-time-machine/releases/download/0.1.0/changetime.exe). The GUI is always-on-top.

The screen lets you change local computer time in steps of 5, 15 and 60 minutes forward and backwards in time. 

**Do mind this is currently for windows (tested on W10-x64) only, pull-requests welcome**

## Setup

Then just run the main application.
